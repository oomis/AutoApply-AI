# --- STORY BANK FOR BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS ---
story_bank:
  - title: "Challenging Project with Tight Deadline"
    situation: "We were tasked with launching a new payment gateway integration within a very aggressive 2-week timeline, which was a critical business requirement."
    task: "My responsibility was to develop the backend service to communicate with the third-party payment API and ensure all transactions were secure and logged correctly."
    action: "I immediately broke the project into small, manageable tasks. I created a robust error-handling module first, then focused on the core transaction logic. I worked closely with the frontend developer to define a clear API contract, which allowed us to work in parallel. I also set up a staging environment to run extensive tests."
    result: "We successfully launched the feature on time with zero production issues. The integration has since processed over $2 million in transactions."
  - title: "Resolving a Team Conflict"
    situation: "Two developers on the team had conflicting ideas about the database schema for a new feature, which was stalling progress."
    task: "As the project lead, I needed to facilitate a resolution that was technically sound and maintained team morale."
    action: "I organized a meeting where each developer presented their proposal without interruption. I then guided a discussion focused on the pros and cons of each approach against our project goals (scalability, maintainability). I proposed a hybrid solution that incorporated the best elements of both ideas."
    result: "The team agreed on the hybrid approach. The conflict was resolved, we moved forward, and the feature was delivered successfully. It also established a better collaborative problem-solving process for the future."
