Design and solve diverse coding problems used to train AI systems.
Write clear, high-quality code snippets and detailed explanations.
Evaluate AI-generated code for accuracy, performance, and clarity.
Provide feedback that directly shapes the next generation of AI models.

About the job
Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.

To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.

Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
 Coinbase is seeking a skilled Backend Engineer to join the Institutional Foundations team. This role offers the opportunity to build and scale systems that are critical to the success of Coinbase Institutional, directly impacting global availability, fund safety, and user experience. You'll collaborate with a talented team to create highly reliable and secure solutions, ensuring a seamless experience for Coinbase's institutional clients.

As an engineer at Coinbase, you will solve unique, large scale, highly complex technical problems, bridging the constraints posed by web-scale applications and blockchain technology. You will help build the next generation of systems to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone across the globe, operating real-time applications with high frequency, low latency updates, and managing the most secure, dockerized infrastructure running in the cloud.

What you'll be doing:


You will build new services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang

You will help articulate a long term vision for maintaining and scaling Coinbase Institutional's backend systems

You will work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn the product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter

You will independently take ownership over the completion and quality of your tasks and projects and write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers

Show bias for action, and data-driven decisions to experiment new solutions as fast as possible


What we look for in you:


You have at least 2 years of experience in software engineering

You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers

You’ve designed, built, scaled and maintained production services, and know how to compose a service oriented architecture

You have experience executing technical tasks and projects end-to-end

You’re passionate about building an open financial system that brings the world together.

You're an excellent written and verbal communicator in English 


Nice to haves:


You have previous professional working experience with Golang, Postgres, MongoDB

You’ve built financial, high reliability or security systems

You have experience with Coinbase products and/or you have experience with Blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc..)

You have gone through a rapid growth in your company (from startup to mid-size)

You have experience decomposing a large monolith into microservices

You are passionate about blockchain technology and a power user of crypto exchange applications or dapps 


Job #: GIBE04UK
 Please be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period. We encourage you to carefully evaluate how your skills and interests align with Coinbase's roles before applying.
